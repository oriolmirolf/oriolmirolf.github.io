  - title: "FROM TRAPS TO TREASURE: AN AGENT ENVIRONMENT FOR SPELUNKY 2'S PROCEDURAL DEPTHS"
    authors: "Víctor González Bentué; Oriol Miró López-Feliu; Víctor Gimenez Abalos"
    venue: "Bachelor Thesis (TFG), UPC – FIB"
    year: 2025
    summary: "I co-directed this thesis which introduces spelunkyRL, a customizable Gymnasium environment for Spelunky 2 via a Lua mod, with procedurally generated, partially observable levels that demand long-horizon planning. Supports flexible tasks and efficient parallelism; reveals algorithmic limits—on-policy methods reach ~85% on simplified levels but struggle with hazards and sparse rewards. "
