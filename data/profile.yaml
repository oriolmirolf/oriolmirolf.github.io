bio: "I am a research engineer at [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es) working in the [HPAI](https://hpai.bsc.es) group. I recently published my first paper (oral presentation!) at [CCIA](https://webs-deim.urv.cat/~itaka/CCIAVALLS2025/index.html). I am also pursuing a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.fib.upc.edu/), [Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/) and [Universitat Rovira i Virgili](https://www.urv.cat/). I am also the head of the electronics department of [ARM2u](https://arm2u-etseib.upc.edu/wp/), a student-led team deveolping an affordable, user-centered myoelectrical transradial prosthetic arm. Last July, we were invited to the United Nations' [AI for Good Summit](https://aiforgood.itu.int) to present our project. I am interested in agents, RL, neuroscience, and societal+cognitive effects of AI. In my free time I tinker with robotics, develop projects that improve my quality of life, solve games with AI agents, read, and do sports."
